# README #

This is the Do Your Homework repository. In this repository, each paper we are reviewing has its own folder. 
The folder is then broken into the two people who will be reviewing each of the papers. Each of those folders
include an executive summary, a rubric, and folders for downloading data and folders for downloading code.
